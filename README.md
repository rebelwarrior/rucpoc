Project originally devised as a way to keep track of bounced checks. The accounting of these is typically held outside the normal accounting to allow for the closing of the fiscal year. Originally the bounced checks have been kept track on a Excel file on a single computer. 

This project has as it's goals the following:

1. Create a persistent database store for the accounting of bounced checks.
2. Allow easy monitoring of said debts.
3. Allow for importing of data (from csv exported from excel file)
4. Present an API for other agencies (particularly the permit agency) to connect.

A further goal is:

- Automatic generation of Mailers for collection efforts.

Due to the expertise found on the EQB (Environmental Quality Board) was limited to Windows this app needed to run on Windows, thus a jruby/java/tomcat7 stack was used.

Instructions for setting up the server machine will be found in the Github Pages.
